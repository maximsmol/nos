triple fault with uint64

boot and krnl may need explicit long jump size specifiers
gdt_entry is defined both in krnl and boot

bld:
  should use kexec/gen.nasm
  should use withFile in getting prtt data

boot:
  should enable a20
  code load:
    should load rest of self if longer than boot sector
    assumes hdd (drive number always 0x80)
    parses LBA incorrectly when reading prtt
    may break if loading > 128 sectors

krnl:
  should load self
    should have only self-loader in kexec
  prtt may need [[gnu::packed]]
  type_traits hacked in

  term:
    will corrupt mem if not init
    putnum can out-of-bounds the alphabet
    no 64 bit printing support

ata:
  should find boot drive
